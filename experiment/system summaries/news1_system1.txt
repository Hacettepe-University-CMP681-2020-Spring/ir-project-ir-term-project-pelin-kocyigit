The use of "invisible" ink is not without its own problems.
The use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills.
The other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink   but as the elections in Afghanistan showed, improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems.
The actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated.
The author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink.
The ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb.
Likewise, any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot.
The use of ink has been controversial   especially among groups perceived to be pro government.
The ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week.
The Kyrgyz Republic, a small, mountainous state of the former Soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.
However, the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light.
In an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as "an island of democracy", the Kyrgyz President, Askar Akaev, pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections.
If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station.
