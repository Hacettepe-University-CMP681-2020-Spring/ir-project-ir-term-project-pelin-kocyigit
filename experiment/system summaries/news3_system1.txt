To supporters of England, Dallaglio could do no wrong.
The only player to play every minute of England's World Cup triumph in Australia, Dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure England's historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by England supporters.
Within two years of his debut, Dallaglio was offered the England captain's band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 Lions tour to South Africa.
But then Dallaglio has always been his own man.
Dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of England's most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.
But after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum, Dallaglio's career hit the buffers at speed in 1999.
Following Johnson's retirement, Dallaglio's career came full circle as Woodward restored him as England captain.
Dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded England side which became the shock winners of the first Rugby Sevens World Cup in 1993.
While England did not hit the heights in Dallaglio's second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post World Cup Tests, Dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many World Cup stars to live up to expectat...
An integral part of a sustained period of success for England, Dallaglio's crowning glory was his part in the side that won the Rugby World Cup in 2003.
But it is as a player that England will really struggle to replace the 32 year old.
Rumours began to circulate that his career was over but, in typical Dallaglio style, he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen.
