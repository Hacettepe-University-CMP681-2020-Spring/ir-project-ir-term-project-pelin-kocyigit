During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars.
Before Wednesday's announcement, BMW had invested some £280m in Mini production.
When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than £10,000.
Less than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced £100m of new investment.
Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini workers.
The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars.
Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge.
Since its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength.
These days, buyers will have to fork out almost £11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to £17,730.
In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award winning Rover 75.
Some 200 new jobs are to be created at the Oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building.
Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini.
