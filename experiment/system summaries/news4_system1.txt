"Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing," the Kok report said.
But the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige.
For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesn't become a global economic laggard.
The economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world's leading economy by 2010.
The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit.
The EU's economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next.
" That's why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth.
" But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality.
The report comes at a time when Europe's competitive position is waning.
" On one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy.
"The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change," said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels based citizen action group.
Lisbon risks becoming a "synonym for missed objectives and failed promises", his report said.
" But part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago.
Neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the EU was to meet its target of becoming a so called "knowledge based economy".
But also the employers' associations.
Mr Barroso has said that the EU's competitiveness will be his top priority.
He expects his five year term in office to be judged on Europe's success in meeting the Lisbon agenda.
